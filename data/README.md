# Datasets

There are two datasets in this folder:
* [Labelled PSB Dataset](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~kalo/papers/LabelMeshes/)
* [Princeton Benchmark](http://shape.cs.princeton.edu/benchmark) (not reachable)

Additionally, there is an .off and .ply example to show both datatypes work

(What also goes into this folder are the preprocessed shapes)
